I am a Data Scientist currently at Neudesic, an IBM Company and am primarily working with NLP models for compute/data-constrained use cases as well as explainability. I have written several papers related to these topics, and have collaborated with IBM and Microsoft employees to help improve their own models for content safety and entailment (groundedness). Recently, I have been interested in various techniques to explain a transformer model's output and am working on ways to apply it at a large scale.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Data Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I worked at the Office of Research Information and helped perform research in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior. From those experiences, I learned a lot about the process of research (especially in the health sciences) and it helped spark my interest in performing my own research.

Outside of data science, I love to read (both fiction and nonfiction), cook, bake, and exercise!
